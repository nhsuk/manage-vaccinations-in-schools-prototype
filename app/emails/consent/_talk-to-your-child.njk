## Talk to your child about what they want

We suggest you talk to your child about the vaccination before you respond to us. Young people have the right to refuse vaccinations.

They also have the [right to consent to their own vaccinations](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/consent-to-treatment/children) if they show they fully understand whatâ€™s involved. Our team might give young people this opportunity if they assess them as suitably competent.
