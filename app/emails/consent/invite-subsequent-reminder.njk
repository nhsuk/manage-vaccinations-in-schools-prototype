## About the {{ programme.name | replace("Flu", "flu") }} vaccine

{{ programme.information.description }}

{% if programme.type == ProgrammeType.Flu %}
The vaccination is a quick and painless spray up the nose. Even if your child had the vaccine last year, the type of flu can vary each winter, so we recommend they have it again this year.

The nasal spray contains gelatine. If your child does not use gelatine products, they could have an injection instead.
