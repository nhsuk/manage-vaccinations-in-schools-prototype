Our team are coming back to {{ session.location.name }} on {{ session.summary.dates }} to give the HPV vaccine.

If you want your child to be vaccinated in school, you need to give your consent.

## About the flu vaccine

The vaccination is a quick and painless spray up the nose. Even if your child had the vaccine last year, the type of flu can vary each winter, so we recommend they have it again this year.

The nasal spray contains gelatine. If your child does not use gelatine products, they could have an injection instead.

## What the vaccine is for

The HPV vaccine helps protect against cancers caused by HPV, including:

- cervical cancer
- some mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers
- some cancers of the anal and genital areas

It also helps protect against genital warts.

The HPV vaccine works best if itâ€™s given before young people become sexually active.
