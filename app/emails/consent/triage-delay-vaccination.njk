Having looked at the answers you gave to the health questions about {{ consent.child.fullAndPreferredNames }}, our nursing team has decided it would be better for {{ consent.child.firstName }} to have the {{ session.vaccinationNames.sentenceCase }} in a clinic rather than at school.

You can book a slot by going to <https://www.swiftqueue.co.uk/userlogin.php>

Slots are normally for 10 minutes. If your child needs more time, please contact the office using the details below.
