## About the nasal spray

The nasal spray contains gelatine. If your child does not use gelatine products, or the nasal spray is not suitable for medical reasons, they could have an injection instead.

The nasal spray gives children the best protection against flu. However, the injected vaccine is a good alternative if the nasal spray vaccine cannot be used.
