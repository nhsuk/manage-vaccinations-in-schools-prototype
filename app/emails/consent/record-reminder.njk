If you haven’t already told {{ consent.child.firstName }} that they’ll be vaccinated, please let them know what to expect.

If {{ consent.child.firstName }}’s health changes, or you arrange to have the vaccination elsewhere, please get in touch. You can email {{ data.team.email }} or call {{ data.team.tel }}.

## Helping the session run smoothly

It’s helpful for {{ consent.child.firstName }} to wear a short-sleeved shirt on the day of vaccination sessions so the nurse has easy access to the arm.

- a high temperature, or feeling hot and shivery
